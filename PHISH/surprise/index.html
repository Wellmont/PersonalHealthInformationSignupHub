<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">No, not really. This was a test by Wellmont's Internal Audit department.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">No part of your Username or Password was actually transmitted or stored. You may send an e-mail to: <a href="mailto:Daniel.Neeley@Wellmont.org">Daniel.Neeley@Wellmont.org</a>&nbsp;to verify.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">BUT</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This could have easily been real, and your entire Wellmont account would have been compromised.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">You might say: "But how would I have known?"</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="www.welllmont.org/images/address.png" alt="So Close, Yet So Far" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Notice anything strange about the address for this site? Look hard.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Okay, but that's pretty sneaky. Was there anything else?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="www.welllmont.org/images/pleasedontclick.png" alt="You Clicked It, Didn't You?" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">It was right there in the original e-mail, all along.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Scary, huh? It can easily happen though, which is why all Employees must be on guard against attacks such as this.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Again, don't worry. You're not in trouble and your password is still safe. If you fell for this though, we would ask that you please send a quick e-mail to <a href="mailto:Daniel.Neeley@Wellmont.org">Daniel.Neeley@Wellmont.org</a>&nbsp;to let us know. We won't be recording your name, or anything like that, we will just be maintaining a generic count of the number of people that were "compromised."</p>
